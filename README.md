### mini-hospital-system
My first educational project so it is considered as mini project . The project was part of "Mastering 4 critical skils using C++" course.
This console project was made as a good application on programming fundamentals using only C++ language.
It is about a hospital has 20 different specializations and we are able to add patients to any of them in a queue as every specialization has its own queue ordered by the priority of comming to the hospital and the urgency of their cases.
We can also get these patients out of the queue by order to the doctors if they are not busy else if the patients wait and if the queue of any specialization itself is empty the doctor of this specialization him self has to wait.
